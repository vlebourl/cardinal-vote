# Technical Task Template

> **Purpose**: Comprehensive template for AI-optimized technical task descriptions that provide maximum context for development teams and AI coding assistants.

## Task Identification

**Task ID**: [T-{number}] (e.g., T-001)  
**Task Name**: [Clear, action-oriented name using verb-noun structure]  
**Priority**: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]

## Context & Background

### Source PRP Document

**Reference**: [docs/prps/{feature-name}.md] - [Link to the PRP document this task was created from]

### Feature Overview

Brief description of the larger feature this task belongs to and its business value.

### Task Purpose

  - body: [response structure]
```

## Acceptance Criteria

### Given-When-Then Scenarios

```gherkin
Scenario 1: [Primary happy path]
  Given [initial context/state]
  When [action is performed]
  Then [expected outcome]
  And [additional verification]

Scenario 2: [Error handling]
  Given [error condition setup]
  When [triggering action]
  Then [error response expected]

Scenario 3: [Edge case]
  Given [edge case context]
  When [action performed]
  Then [expected behavior]
```
