# Brainstorming Session: ToV√©Co to Cardinal-Vote Repository Rename

**Date:** September 8, 2025  
**Facilitator:** Claude Code (Brainstorming Agent)  
**Participants:** Development Team  
**Session Duration:** ~15 minutes  
**Session Type:** Feature Implementation Planning

---

## üìã Executive Summary

This brainstorming session focused on systematically renaming all "toveco" references to "cardinal_vote" throughout the codebase as part of finalizing the generalized platform transformation. The GitHub repository has already been renamed to "cardinal-vote", and this effort ensures internal consistency across all code, documentation, and configuration files.

**Key Decision:** Complete elimination of all "toveco" references using "cardinal_vote" as the universal replacement convention.

---

## üéØ Feature Overview

### Problem Statement

The repository contains legacy "toveco" references throughout the codebase that need to be systematically renamed to "cardinal_vote" to align with the already-renamed GitHub repository and completed generalization work.

### Feature Goal

Achieve complete internal consistency by eliminating all "toveco" references from the active codebase while maintaining full functionality.

### Target Users

- **Primary:** Development team maintaining the codebase
- **Secondary:** Future contributors who need clear, consistent naming

### Success Metrics

- Zero "toveco" references remain in active codebase (excluding git history)
- All functionality preserved after rename
- Clean CI/CD pipeline post-rename

## üí° Key Ideas & Solutions

### Core Solution Approach

**Systematic Replacement Strategy:** Execute a comprehensive find-and-replace operation across all layers of the application using a structured, category-by-category approach.

### Implementation Categories Identified

1. **Database Layer**
   - Table names and schema references
   - Constraint and index names
   - Database configuration

2. **Code Structure**
   - Folder names (`src/toveco_voting/` ‚Üí `src/cardinal_vote/`)
   - File names containing "toveco"
   - Package names and import statements

3. **Configuration & Infrastructure**
   - Docker container names and configurations
   - Environment variable names
   - CI/CD configuration references

4. **Documentation & Testing**
   - README files and documentation
   - Test file names and test class names
   - Code comments and documentation strings

### Naming Convention Decision

- **Replacement Pattern:** All "toveco" ‚Üí "cardinal_vote"
- **Consistency Rule:** Use underscore format throughout (not dash or camel case)
- **Scope:** Complete elimination - no toveco references preserved

---

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Preparation

- **Branch Creation:** `chore/rename-toveco-to-cardinal-vote`
- **Reference Audit:** Run comprehensive `grep -r "toveco"` to catalog all instances
- **Backup Strategy:** Ensure clean git state before starting

### Phase 2: Systematic Execution (Order Matters)

1. **Database & Schema** (First - to avoid dependency cascades)
   - Rename database names and table names
   - Update foreign key constraints and indexes
   - Modify migration files

2. **Folder Structure** (Second - affects all imports)
   - `src/toveco_voting/` ‚Üí `src/cardinal_vote/`
   - Update any other directory names

3. **File Names** (Third - before content changes)
   - Identify and rename files containing "toveco"
   - Update any reference files

4. **Code References** (Fourth - bulk of the work)
   - Package import statements
   - Class names and variable names
   - Function and method references

5. **Configuration Files** (Fifth - infrastructure consistency)
   - Docker compose files and Dockerfile
   - Environment variable files
   - CI/CD workflow configurations

6. **Documentation** (Sixth - user-facing content)
   - README files and markdown documentation
   - Code comments and docstrings
   - API documentation

7. **Testing** (Last - ensure everything works)
   - Test file names and class names
   - Test data and fixtures
   - Integration test configurations

### Phase 3: Validation & Quality Assurance

- **Reference Check:** `grep -r "toveco"` should return zero results
- **Build Validation:** Ensure application builds successfully
- **Test Suite:** Run full test suite to confirm functionality
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Validate all automated checks pass

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Identified Risks

| Risk                          | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy                              |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Import statement breakage     | Medium      | High   | Test builds after folder/import changes          |
| Database connection issues    | Low         | High   | Update database configs first, test connection   |
| CI/CD pipeline failures       | Low         | Medium | Update configs incrementally, validate each step |
| Hidden reference dependencies | Low         | Medium | Comprehensive grep audit before and after        |

### Mitigation Strategies

- **Small, Focused Commits:** Each category gets its own commit for easy rollback
- **Incremental Testing:** Test builds and core functionality between major phases
- **Systematic Validation:** Use grep and automated tools to verify completeness
- **Standard Review Process:** Follow established PR review workflow

---

## üîß Technical Requirements

### Prerequisites

- Clean working directory (no uncommitted changes)
- Access to development database for schema changes
- Full test suite in working condition

### Tools & Commands

```bash
# Reference discovery
grep -r "toveco" . --exclude-dir=.git

# Systematic replacement (example)
find . -name "*.py" -exec sed -i 's/toveco_voting/cardinal_vote/g' {} +

# Validation
grep -r "toveco" . --exclude-dir=.git | wc -l  # Should return 0
```

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Run after code reference changes
- **Integration Tests:** Run after configuration changes
- **Build Tests:** Run after folder structure changes
- **End-to-End:** Full test suite before PR submission

## üìù Decisions Made

### Primary Decisions

1. **Naming Convention:** "cardinal_vote" (underscore format) for all replacements
2. **Scope:** Complete elimination of all "toveco" references
3. **Execution Order:** Database ‚Üí Folders ‚Üí Files ‚Üí Code ‚Üí Config ‚Üí Docs ‚Üí Tests
4. **Branch Strategy:** Single feature branch for entire rename operation
5. **Preservation Policy:** No toveco references preserved (excluding git history)

### Validation Criteria

- Zero toveco references in active codebase
- All CI/CD checks passing
- Full functionality preserved
- Clean documentation consistency
