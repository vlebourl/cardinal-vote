# Brainstorming Session: Generalized Platform Development Strategy

**Date:** January 7, 2025  
**Facilitator:** Claude (Scrum Master)  
**Participants:** Product Owner  
**Duration:** Planning Session  
**Session Type:** Strategic Planning & Timeline Optimization

## 1. Feature Context & Requirements

### Feature Overview

Transform the current single-purpose Cardinal Vote logo voting application into a generalized multi-tenant voting platform as a service, enabling users to create custom votes and share them with participants.

### Current State Analysis

- **Working Cardinal Vote Platform**: 101 vote records, SQLite database, Docker deployment
- **Comprehensive PRP Document**: 12-week horizontal phase approach planned
- **Technical Foundation**: FastAPI backend, responsive frontend, CI/CD pipeline
- **Target Users**: Homelab enthusiasts seeking self-hosted voting solutions

### Key Requirements Identified

- **Multi-tenant architecture** with user registration and authentication
- **Custom vote creation** with text and image options
- **Unique shareable voting links** with anonymous participation
- **Admin panels** for vote creators and platform super-admin
- **Self-hosted deployment** optimized for Docker and local storage

## 2. User Stories & Use Cases

### Primary User Stories

1. **As a homelab user**, I want to deploy a voting platform so that I can create custom votes for my community
2. **As a vote creator**, I want to register and create votes with custom options so that I can gather opinions democratically
3. **As a participant**, I want to access votes via unique links and vote anonymously with just my name
4. **As a platform admin**, I want to manage users and moderate content so that I can maintain a healthy platform

### Key Use Cases

- **Community Decision Making**: Users creating votes for group decisions (movie nights, meeting times, etc.)
- **Opinion Gathering**: Collecting feedback with value-based rating system (-2 to +2)
- **Family/Friend Polling**: Simple sharing via URLs for casual decision making
- **Self-Hosted Privacy**: Full data control without third-party services

## 3. Technical Architecture Decisions

### Core Technology Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI + PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy (upgraded from SQLite)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript + Modern CSS (no framework dependencies)
- **Deployment**: Docker + Docker Compose for self-hosted environments
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens + bcrypt password hashing
- **Database**: Multi-tenant with Row-Level Security (RLS) for data isolation

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Storage Strategy**: Local filesystem with Docker volumes (not cloud storage)
2. **Email Service**: Mock emails for development, configurable SMTP for production
3. **Sharing Mechanism**: Simple unique URLs only (defer advanced sharing features)
4. **File Handling**: PNG/JPG support with local processing and volume persistence
5. **Security Model**: IP-based duplicate prevention, CAPTCHA integration planned

### Database Migration Strategy

- **Clean Break**: No backward compatibility required with Cardinal Vote platform
- **Fresh Schema**: Complete PostgreSQL multi-tenant design
- **Data Preservation**: Migrate existing Cardinal Vote votes as historical reference
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with core tables, expand in phases

## 4. Implementation Strategy

### Original PRP Timeline Issues Identified

- **Waterfall Approach**: No working platform until week 10-12
- **Late Integration**: High risk of integration issues discovered late
- **Delayed Feedback**: No user validation until very end of development
- **Resource Inefficiency**: Team blocked waiting for foundation layers

### Revised Vertical Slice Approach

**Phase 1: Core MVP (4-5 weeks)** - Complete working generalized platform

- Week 1: Database + Auth foundation
- Week 2: Basic vote creation (text options)
- Week 3: Public voting experience
- Week 4: Results display + creator dashboard
- Week 5: Core platform polish + email verification

**Phase 2: Essential Admin (3-4 weeks)** - Platform management capabilities

- Week 6: Super admin foundation + user management
- Week 7: Vote moderation + content oversight
- Week 8: Enhanced creator dashboard + analytics

**Phase 3: Enhanced UX (2-3 weeks)** - Security and user experience

- Week 9: CAPTCHA + security hardening
- Week 10: Image upload system
- Week 11: UX polish + accessibility

**Phase 4: Production Package (1-2 weeks)** - Deployment readiness

- Week 12: Documentation + deployment guides

## 5. Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas

1. **Multi-Tenant Data Isolation**
   - _Risk_: Users accessing other users' data
   - _Mitigation_: PostgreSQL RLS + comprehensive testing
   - _Timeline Impact_: Could delay Phase 1 by 1 week

2. **Authentication Security**
   - _Risk_: Vulnerable authentication implementation
   - _Mitigation_: Use established JWT patterns + security audit
   - _Timeline Impact_: Security review built into each phase

3. **Database Migration Complexity**
   - _Risk_: Data loss during SQLite to PostgreSQL migration
   - _Mitigation_: Clean break approach, comprehensive backups
   - _Timeline Impact_: Minimal - no backward compatibility needed

### Medium-Risk Areas

1. **File Upload System**: Local storage limits and processing complexity
2. **Email Configuration**: Production deployment complexity for different SMTP providers
3. **Performance at Scale**: Multi-tenant query performance optimization needs

### Low-Risk Areas

1. **UI/UX Changes**: Building on proven responsive design
2. **Docker Deployment**: Established containerization approach
3. **Core Voting Logic**: Proven -2 to +2 rating system

## 6. Success Metrics & Validation

### Phase 1 Success Criteria

- [ ] User can register, login, create vote, and receive responses
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation verified (users see only their data)
- [ ] Mobile-responsive interface functional across devices
- [ ] Basic security measures prevent common vulnerabilities
- [ ] Performance acceptable for expected user load (few dozen concurrent)

### Phase 2 Success Criteria

- [ ] Super admin can manage all users and votes effectively

## 8. Decisions & Rationale

### Strategic Decisions Made

1. **Vertical Slice Timeline Adopted**
   - _Rationale_: Faster feedback, reduced integration risk, working platform sooner
   - _Impact_: 5-week MVP vs 12-week original timeline
   - _Trade-offs_: Some features deferred but platform functional earlier

2. **Simplified Technology Choices**
   - _Rationale_: Self-hosted homelab focus requires simple deployment
   - _Impact_: Local storage, mock emails, basic sharing only
   - _Trade-offs_: Less enterprise features but easier deployment

3. **Clean Break from Cardinal Vote**
   - _Rationale_: No backward compatibility needed enables faster development
   - _Impact_: Complete architectural freedom, optimized multi-tenant design
   - _Trade-offs_: Migration effort but better end result

4. **Admin Features as MVP**
   - _Rationale_: Platform management essential for self-hosted deployments
   - _Impact_: Admin capabilities in Phase 2 (weeks 6-8)
   - _Trade-offs_: Slightly longer MVP but necessary for platform viability

### Technical Architecture Decisions

1. **PostgreSQL with RLS**: Multi-tenant data isolation strategy
2. **FastAPI + Vanilla JS**: Maintain current technology familiarity
3. **Docker-First Deployment**: Optimized for homelab environment
4. **JWT Authentication**: Stateless authentication for scalability

### Development Process Decisions

1. **Feature Branch Strategy**: Maintain develop/generalized-platform integration branch
2. **Weekly Sprint Cycles**: Align with vertical slice timeline
3. **Continuous Integration**: Maintain current CI/CD pipeline approach
4. **Documentation-First**: Document deployment for self-hosted users
